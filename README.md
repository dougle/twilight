Write a small example in Typescript / nodejs.

 
There is no right or wrong answer here and do as much or as little as you like - just wanting to get a feel for coding style and ability.  Think clean, tidy, well-structured code over features / functionality.  Good naming is also a bonus.

 
Structure and arrange as you wish.

 
Will be looking for you to talk over the code and how it works.

 
Basic example:
 
* Generate a list of 100 random lat / long points around the world
* Using https://sunrise-sunset.org/api, fetch the sunrise / sunset times
* Run 5 requests in parrallel, run next 5 after 5 second break if they've all finished
* Find earliest sunrise and list the day length for this time
* Wrap api into a class
* Now assume the calling code will be getting lots of different data from different services about each point (sunrise times just being one). 


Bonus points:
* Install and use ramda, implement some functional programming
* Use ES6/7 array features
* Use async / await
* Handle errors properly
* Additional functionality
* Unit tests
